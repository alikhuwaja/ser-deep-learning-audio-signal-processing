Overall project status:

**COMPLETED WEEK 1 MILESTONES**
* Datasets indexed, audio preprocessing + log-Mel features working, dataset class ready, Mel-spectrograms plotted for RAVDESS and CREMA-D.

scripts/indexes.py:

* Creates CSV index files for RAVDESS and CREMA-D listing file paths, emotions, and IDs.

config.py:

* Stores paths (project/data/CSV) and main hyperparameters (sample rate, mel settings, batch size, epochs, etc.).

features.py:

* Loads audio at 16 kHz mono, fixes length, and converts it to log-Mel spectrogram features.

dataset.py:

* PyTorch Dataset that reads the CSVs and returns (log-Mel features, emotion label) for each audio file.

scripts/mel_spectogram.py:

* Plots example Mel-spectrograms from RAVDESS and CREMA-D using Librosa + Matplotlib.


WHAT NEXT TO DO:

*Week 2 and 3 Milestones
*After Week 2 and 3 are done, then implements the evaluation matrices week 4
